# Unlocking Confidential Computing: An Introduction to Confidential Containers in Kubernetes

As organizations increasingly move sensitive workloads to the cloud, ensuring data confidentiality during execution has become a critical challenge. Confidential Containers (CoCo), a CNCF sandbox project, addresses this by integrating confidential computing principles into the cloud-native ecosystem. Leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and hardware-backed security technologies such as Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and IBM Secure Execution, CoCo enables Kubernetes users to run containerized applications in isolated, attested environments—without modifying existing workflows.
In this session, we’ll explore:

What is Confidential Computing and why it matters?
The architecture and trust model behind Confidential Containers.
Key features: attestation, pod-centric design, and integration with Kata Containers.
Use cases across regulated industries, AI/ML workloads, and multi-tenant environments.
A look at the ecosystem and roadmap, and how you can get started.

Whether you’re a platform engineer, security architect, or cloud-native enthusiast, this talk will demystify confidential computing and show how CoCo brings stronger guarantees of data confidentiality, integrity, and code integrity to Kubernetes.
